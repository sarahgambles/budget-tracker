# **Budget Tracker**

Budget Tracker is a way for users to track their money on-the-go. It provides offline functionality that stores and saves their transactions when they aren't able to use WiFi. 

## Description
This project is to update an existing budget tracking application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total will update when they're brought back online. 

## Installation
Use Heroku to install Budget Tracker

## Usage
Type in an expense or deposit, the amount, and then it will store that data in a graph.
